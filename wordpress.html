<h2>My experience in WordPress</h2>
<p class="left3info">
    I wasn't much of a fan of WordPress, although it was easy to use, I think it was a bit confusing. Since we've only used the free version, the feature was limited.
    One thing that was different about WordPress is everthing that you have to add is in blocks. I think those who are new to making websites will really like this feature.
    I really like the feature (code editor) when I'm done with designing the website, I could turn it into html. Some things that I struggled are making the homepage and what to put in my resume and work page, 
    as I don't have a lot of works that I could include just yet.

            For this assignment, we were tasked to make a portfolio. I've included a homepage, about me, works, resume, and contact page. For each page, we could use a template available to us.
