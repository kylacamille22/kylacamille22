<h2>My experience in Sqaurespace</h2>
<p class="left3info">
    I've heard a lot about Squarespace, as it's been mentioned quite a bit in most social media platforms. I really like working in Sqaurespace more than WordPress. The templates available are more on my style and aethetically pleasing. 
    I think Squarespace is way better when doing online selling and personal blog is probably best for WordPress. The website was really easy to use and I didn't have to code anything, so It didn't took a long time to create.

            For this assignment, we were tasked to make a real or imaginary business website. I chose to do a pottery business, as I hope to have one in the future. Since my main focus is pottery, I went with a cool tone beige theme because it reminds me of clay and glazes.
